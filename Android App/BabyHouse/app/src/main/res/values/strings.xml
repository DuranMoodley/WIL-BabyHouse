    <string name="HomeFragmentContent">\nThe LaLucia Baby House is a transitional home for abandoned babies. But we are much more than an orphanage. We are all about adoption! Our role is to love and care for the babies and prepare them for their forever families. Our goal is that they are with their new families before their first birthday.
    All of our babies come to us through the Adoption Team at Durban Child Welfare. Each baby has itâ€™s own social worker who is working to match them with adoptive families.

We can take up to 6 babies at a time and most of them are under 1 year of age. We have an experienced, hardworking group of care-givers who care for the babies 24 hours a day \n \n \n \n</string>
